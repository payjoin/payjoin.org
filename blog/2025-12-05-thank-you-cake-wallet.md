Feedback from implementations fuels our growth, and we want to thank Cake Wallet for being their close collaboration and reporting which helped lead to our stable rust-payjoin 1.0 release candidate. Just now, they have offered generous material support to the Payjoin Foundation to continue operations.

Cake wallet has been leading the way on the cutting edge of Bitcoin privacy technology and user experience. Async Payjoin is now their default Bitcoin flow, and their early support helps us improve so that more wallets and software may interoperate with Cake's use of the BIP 77 standard.

Cake wallet also runs an OHTTP Relay which users can use to reach Payjoin Directories, making the Payjoin infrastructure more robust and decentralized.

Vik's incessant Payjoin evangelism has brought Payjoin to a new audience at conferences, online, and in my experience even on the fly at chance meetings in restaurants. His message is clear: the world needs more Payjoin, and the time to support it is now. Seth has been a pleasure to work with since the beginning of the project, nudging developers to use the tools, offering his hand to contribute edits to the upstream source to improve the developer experience, and of course convincing the Cake team Payjoin needs doing. Konstantin has been the most reliable implementing developer, getting up at odd hours to service requests from our team and user feedback, and contributing his feedback to inform the integration upstream. The Cake pilot integration brings Async Payjoin to hundreds of thousands of devices.

Their recent generous donation to Payjoin Foundation additionally bolsters our ability to recruit and improve the core protocol libraries.

Thank you Cake for your generous support. The future of Bitcoin depends on it.
