Cake Wallet has been leading the way on the cutting edge of Bitcoin privacy technology with their early and ongoing support of Payjoin (also known as P2EP) in both their Bitcoin and Monero wallets.

Cake Wallet also runs an OHTTP Relay which users can use to reach Payjoin Directories, making the Payjoin infrastructure more robust and decentralized.

Thank you Cake for your generous support. The future of Bitcoin depends on it.
