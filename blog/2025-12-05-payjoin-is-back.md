A couple years back, we had an email list that gave regular updates on Payjoin's progress from Chaincase/[Payjoin Substack](https://payjoin.substack.com/). If you are receiving this as an email, it's because you were a subscriber on that list.

We're the same team who has pivoted since we have traction here. Since then, we've worked hard to create [PDK](https://payjoin.org/blog/2023/06/27/pdk-an-sdk-for-payjoin-transactions), [Payjoin Foundation](https://payjoin.org/blog/2025/08/08/announcing-payjoin-foundation), and a great team that's moving fast.

Stay tuned for email updates on Payjoin's progress, and always feel free to send us feedback, either via our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/6rJD9R684h) or on [Github](https://github.com/payjoin).

Onward!
