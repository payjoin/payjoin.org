The new payjoin client is live ðŸ–– [Payjoin.org](https://payjoin.org)
launched the ability to send and receive payjoin from the static website
using new Payjoin Software Development Kit. The response proved demand
for better ways to collect payments without revealing the destination of
those funds to the public. This experiement created loads of feedback we
can use to help your favorite wallets and business integrate this
bitcoin privacy upgrade.

## **Decrypt Covers Payjoin**

Alyssa Hertig broke down the goals of payjoin.org and how it works into
prose rather than jargon:

> PayJoins are different. They\'re a CoinJoin between just two
> users---the buyer and the merchant---at the time of sale. As such,
> PayJoins can be baked into the process of buying anything with
> Bitcoin.

Share it with a skeptic, their mind might change.

## **Geyser Campaign**

[The Payjoin project has raised two million sats on
Geyser](https://geyser.fund/project/payjoin/), enough to run basic
payjoin server infrastructure for more than a year! Funders are eligible
for a [Payjoin Supporter nostr
badge](https://badges.page/b/naddr1qqghqctedfhkjm3dwd6hqur0wf6x2uszyqn9sd3vxym742qpltjqf03kllyqu94xr3p63ydr5prta39h9eyc5qcyqqq82wg0z8tmw)
for their support.

## **A How-to Deep Dive**

When payjoin.org was put up a few weeks back, there was a demand for a
step by step walkthrough of the process. In particular, the feedback
asked for an explanation of what the Payjoin SDK does so that payjoin
could be implemented it in other languages than Rust too. I'm publishing
[this early
draft](https://github.com/payjoin/rust-payjoin/blob/66ab3c39e64c3769c78df161b57a006bb22105db/MENTAL-MODEL.md)
for feedback in an effort to answer that demand; build, show, and tell,
more in public; and to kickstart foreign language bindings support. It
should also help the Summer of Bitcoin students [get payjoin into the
Bitcoin Dev
Kit](https://github.com/payjoin/rust-payjoin/blob/66ab3c39e64c3769c78df161b57a006bb22105db/MENTAL-MODEL.md).

## **Bonus Podcast: Global Bitcoin Fest Taiwan ðŸŽ§**

My heart is in Taiwan, and its bitcoin scene is taking off. Virtually
all of the ASIC chips for miners are manufactured there. Listen for a
history and the future of bitcoin business, manufacturing, policy, and
culture in Taiwan. It's worth a listen.
